<h1> Why I love cross country!</h1>


<p>To many, running is never fun. Maybe you think so too and guess what, 
I'm not surprised!</p>


<p>"IT IS INDEED A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE!"</p>

<p>But the outcome is always so good!</p>

<p>That doesn't mean it'salways about winning. Infact, 
just hanging out with the awesome Midd XC team is enough for me! </P>

<p> So I started running about 1 year ago after 
I joined <a href="http://www.kensap.org">KenSAP</a> which means 
Kenya-Scholar Athlete Project.

<p> It turned out I could perform this "means of terestial locomotion" 
as <a href=http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> calls it.
<P> And now I am racing in the <a href="http://www.nescac.com">NESCAC</a> league.
<p> I am aiming at participating in the <a href="http://www.bostonmarathon.com">
Boston Marathon</a> 10 K run in two years time.

<p> And ooh incase you haven't figured that out yet, David Rudisha is my hero!</P>
